# NLP_texts
Exploratory Text Analytics project on corpus of political texts

The first step of the project was to create different tables with text information from the corpus of data. These tables include a Token, Vocab, Library, TF-IDF and reduced TF-IDF tables. Next using these tables I sought to test my hypothesis on this corpus and see if we could accuractly cluster the corpus. I incorporated simple clustering, PCA, Topic Modeling, Word Embedding, and Sentiment Analysis.
